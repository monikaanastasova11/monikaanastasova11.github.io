                <h2>Story</h2>
                <p>Intrigued by the enigmatic manuscript, Lowen Ashleigh devised a plan to infiltrate the secrets veiled within the old house by the lake. Posing as a caregiver, she secured a position within the Crawford household, living under the same roof as Verity in her semi-comatose state.

                    The old house stood as a sentinel, its facade adorned with rich wood panelling, and the roof covered with soft slate slabs. The air around it whispered tales of times long past, and the well-kept gardens, with ancient trees standing like sentinels, seemed to guard the mysteries within.
                    
                    Under the guise of a caring companion, Lowen observed the intricate dance of the Crawford family. The rich wood panelling within the house enveloped her in a cocoon of history, as if the walls held the echoes of secrets waiting to be unravelled.
                    
                    Verity Crawford, confined to her room and unaware of Lowen's ulterior motives, became the focal point of the charade. The gardens, adorned with blooming flowers and ancient trees, transformed into a stage for Lowen's clandestine investigations.
                    
                    Each day brought a delicate balancing act for Lowenâ€”playing the role of caregiver while unravelling the threads of Verity's past. The terrace overlooking the lake became her refuge, a place to reflect on the complexities of the situation. The soft slate slabs of the roof seemed to absorb the weight of the secrets, echoing with the hushed whispers of the lake.</p>
